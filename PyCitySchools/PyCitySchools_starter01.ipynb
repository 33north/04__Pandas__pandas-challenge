      "One of the reason for the high % overall passing scores for schools with 2000 students or less could be that\n",
      "because the schools have less students, class sizes are smaller and allow teachers to focus on more students.\n",
      "The school with the largest student body is Bailey High School with 4976 students and a score of 54.64%.\n",
      "The school with the highest % overall passing score is Cabrera High School with a population of 1858.  The \n",
      "student size of Bailey High School is a little over 2.5 times the size of Cabrera High School.  This means that\n",
      "class sizes at Bailey High School are 2.5 times larger than the class sizes at Cabrera High School.  Hence, \n",
      "teachers at a school with a higher student count are looking after more students and may not be able to give\n",
      "attention to all the students that need it versus teachers at a school with lower student count are taking care\n",

      "best attention to each student.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another reason that works in conjunction with a school's student count is the school type.  We have only two types\n",
      "of schools: charter schools and district schools.  Based on the School Summary data, charter type schools are the\n",
      "schools that have 2000 students or less with the exception of Wilson High School.  District type schools have\n",
      "more students than charter type schools.  The district high school with the closest student count to Wilson \n",
      "High School is Ford High School with 2739 students.  That is a 456 student difference between the charter school\n",
      "with the highest student population among charter school and the district school with the lowest student population\n",
      "among district school.  And yet the charter school is the one that has a higher % overall passing score.\n",

      "the % overall passing score a school receives.  Not necessarily the reason but schools that score 88% or higher\n",
      "on the % overall passing score, tend to be schools that have lower spending budget per student.  However, this is\n",
      "due in part to the small student population of those types of school.\n",
