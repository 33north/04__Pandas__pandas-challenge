Using the pandas library, we analyzed standardized test result data of high schools within a district in order to find trends in school performance.  This data will be important in making and setting budgets and financial priorities for the future.

We first put together a district-wise summary of the performance data. 
The data looks at the following categories and found the total of:
  - schools
  - students
  - budget
  - average math and reading scores
  - percentage of students passing math and reading
  - percentage of students passing both math and reading.

We further separated out the data to look at those categories at the school level.

Both the district summary and the school summary offer a convenient overview of the data for each category.

In order to find trends in school performance, we looked at the following:
  - Math scores by grade
  - Reading scores by grade
  - Scores by school spending
  - Scores by school size
  - Scores by school type

From the data, we were able to see some trends regarding school performance.  This is helpful in set budgets and financial priorities for the district and the city.
